# Bloons+ roadmap and repair list

Updated 4 October 2026. Checkboxes require evidence, not merely code. Preserve original CHIMPS recordings and BTD6 saves. Gameplay stays behind simulated input.

## P0 — replay reliability

- [ ] Calibrate the hero picker at 1080p and 1440p. Verify displayed hero name and Select/Selected state. Current button OCR can return `unknown`; the runner now skips safely, but that still leaves modes unfinished.
- [ ] Confirm free and paid placements visually when cash is unchanged; handle free Dart Monkey knowledge and Deflation starting cash without endless retries.
- [ ] Confirm tower upgrades from the panel and tier state before advancing. Cash alone is ambiguous while bloons generate income. Retry only the same tier safely.
- [ ] Keep round OCR synchronized through tower panels, fast forward, effects and UI scaling. Check the new monotonic recovery against live 1080p/1440p runs and bound `await_round` stalls.
- [ ] Verify cash OCR with tower panels on either side and Double Cash active; reject sell-price and implausible-HUD reads.
- [ ] Never exit a viable game only because planned actions ended. Continue to actual victory or defeat, and claim a clear only after the medal is saved.
- [ ] Include game frame, action, target position, selected tower/hero, cash and round in failure evidence. Redact private profile data from shared logs.
- [ ] Add bounded recovery for placement, upgrade, navigation and stalled rounds. After a real defeat, try a different route candidate without replaying earned medals.
- [ ] Investigate known failures: Hedge CHIMPS round 6; Scrapyard CHIMPS round 42; Spa Pits ABR round 24; Spa Pits Deflation hero mismatch; Cubism upgrade and round ambiguity. Keep original CHIMPS routes intact.

## P1 — routes and sweep

- [ ] Check every route against mode restrictions, required paths, available hero, game version and map layout. Catalog presence alone does not prove victory.
- [ ] Build evidence-backed routes for missing maps/modes. Mark a converted route verified only after victory and saved medal are observed.
- [ ] Detect map mechanics including moving terrain, freezing, layout changes, obstacles and sightlines before placements or upgrades.
- [ ] Reconcile newly earned medals from the read-only profile after each run, skip saved medals, and resume partial sweeps after restarts.
- [ ] Record per-route success/failure history and exact skip reasons: locked upgrade, hero, map, restriction, or known failure.
- [ ] Confirm Expert-to-Beginner sweep and randomized order within categories without repeating excluded candidates.

## P1 — progress and diagnostics

- [ ] Check MM/hour and XP/hour against several live VM save updates, rank changes and spending; display no rate until enough samples exist.
- [ ] Confirm level, veteran rank, Monkey Money, hero ownership, Monkey Knowledge, tower XP and T1–T5 unlocks from the VM save with source and freshness.
- [ ] Reconcile achievement progress with Steam unlock state and clearly label unsupported progress.
- [ ] Fix activity ages and victory/defeat counters; require victory plus saved medal before adding a clear.
- [ ] Keep redacted full logs and group route failures by actionable cause, even if an old game-state file survives.
- [ ] Keep host UI and guest controller connected after VM updates/restarts; expose the specific failing step.

## P2 — installer and distribution

- [ ] Validate a clean Windows install without Python, Visual C++ runtime, App Sandbox or VM; show progress and repair action per prerequisite.
- [ ] Verify Steam sign-in, BTD6 install/launch, SSH provisioning, port bridge and guest app update without storing Steam credentials.
- [ ] Test partial-install repair and reuse healthy components without changing existing Steam or game data.
- [ ] Publish the next installer with checksum, release notes, verification limits and a working site download.
- [ ] Add trusted code signing when available; unsigned installers may show SmartScreen warnings.

## P2 — product and site

- [ ] Check Subscriptions in light/dark, desktop/mobile, keyboard and reduced-motion modes. Pro is planned at $5.99/month or $40 lifetime for 31 October 2026; checkout and entitlements do not exist yet.
- [ ] Keep Features, About, Wiki, Contributors and Subscriptions visually tied to BTD6 with independent-project attribution.
- [ ] Make app category switching, scrolling and the VM viewer responsive without polling viewer frames when its tab is closed.
- [ ] Tidy repo folders without blindly moving runtime data. Exclude personal saves, logs, keys, VM images and private Discord bot source.

## Later — experimental systems

- [ ] Test autonomous strategy/placement assistance behind experimental settings, with redacted gameplay observations and route-level evidence before live decisions.
- [ ] Add boss events only after modifiers, restrictions, version compatibility and executable routes have victory checks.
- [ ] Finalize Pro features and entitlements before launch. The current examples are ideas, not shipped features.

## Completed in this pass

- [x] Refuse to start a route when the hero picker cannot confirm the required hero.
- [x] Verify live hero Select/Selected state at 1920×1080 and recover stale portrait indices by scanning displayed hero names.
- [x] Detect left tower panels across cyan and purple portrait cards without treating Glacial Trail's ice as a panel.
- [x] Read shifted cash with a left tower panel and Double Cash active; reject the repeated `$1,300` → `51,300` glyph artifact.
- [x] Keep a replay alive after its planned actions end; Tricky Tracks Hard reached round 80, showed victory, saved the medal, and was skipped afterward.
- [x] Execute canonical route ability actions instead of dropping them as unsupported.
- [x] Relay pause, stop, and stop-after controls directly to the guest across transient status-probe disconnects.
- [x] Recover round OCR from bounded monotonic full-HUD readings; observed `27/80` resynchronization in a live replay.
- [x] Classify new hero-picker failures as navigation bugs instead of gameplay defeats.
- [x] Add failure-category counts to the app diagnostics summary.

## Release and site refresh (2026-10-04)

- [x] Replace the README banner with a richer Bloons+ map and balloon composition.
- [x] Replace lifetime pricing with a monthly/annual subscription switch.
- [x] Make the download page resolve the newest published GitHub installer automatically, with a local metadata fallback.
- [x] Add more map environments and expand the public feature list.
- [x] Stop Glacial Trail emergency spending from pulling recorded actions into freeze windows.
- [ ] Validate frozen-tower upgrade deferral against a live Glacial Trail run before marking the route confirmed.
